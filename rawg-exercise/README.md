# RAWG APP FRONTEND (WEB App)

Generated with:
- **[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)** v14
## How can I get the frontend to start?

You're here because you aren't running Docker. So, you need to
run some ``NPM`` commands to get the backend running:

```
npm install
npm start
```
That's it! Frontend (Web App) should be running now.

By default, at http://localhost:4200
