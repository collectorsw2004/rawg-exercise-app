# RAWG APP FRONTEND (WEB App)

Generated with:
- **[Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)** v14
## How can I get the frontend to start?

You're here because you aren't running Docker.

First, if not already installed, you'll need to install NodeJS. You can find your installer [HERE](https://nodejs.org/es/download/).

Then, go to  *"/rawg-exercise"*  directory;  you'll need to run some ``NPM`` commands to get the frontend running:
```
npm install
npm start
```
That's it! Frontend (Web App) should be running now.

By default, at http://localhost:4200
